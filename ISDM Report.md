# ISDM Report

## Tasks

Each group will produce a business report of not more than 2000 words covering the following tasks in relation to an information systems development project:

---

1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology). (Terry)
2. Identify stakeholders. (Terry)
3. Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.(Oliver)
4. Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. In your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use.(William)
5. List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.(William)
6. Document your proposed work products and models. (Aliza)
7. Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information system. Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information system project fails (Oliver)
8. Document in GitHub all your iteration and models as you progress.

## Describe your Approach

The solution must divert time invested away from the RM, without causing additional stresses to the customers in order to retain the business. For this to be successful - the approach must use the data collected about both the customers and the relationship managers to streamline the process, rather than relying on automated survey systems on the customer's end.

This narrows the possible solutions down. The system will have to be automated to manage the large quantity of both customers and staff. Therefore, the system will connect customer with RM's based on one of the following criteria:

1. Predefined attributes given to each party upon contact with the company, based on evaluation, that match the RM's skills with the customer's requirements.
2. Attributes that are self identified by the RM and customer, that establish the RM's personal understanding of their skill set, and the customer's personal requirements in a relationship manager.

Unfortunately these values are static, modifiable only through manual changes. It will therefore require a more dynamic process afterwards to ensure the relevancy of the data. This could be achieved via a dynamic system: a process that evaluates the interactions RM's have with the customers based on the outcome - did the customer buy a product? Did they send a complaint? And uses this information to create a portfolio for each RM and customer with information about positive and negative outcomes. This portfolio can link RM's and customers with each other based on the previous experiences they had with similar RM's or customers.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The automatic adjustment of customer requirements, and the lack of automated surveys ensures the customer is treated to the best service at little to no expense on their part. This provides an important connection between the company and its customers.

While the company's objective is to help customers more efficiently, this also helps the customer get what they want faster, building even stronger relationships between the two.

The reliance on the system to create matches between RMs and customers creates an unfortunate situation in which any failure in the new system could be critical for business operations. The documentation it creates however, regarding RM and customer portfolios, can allow for functional connections to be made during shutdown, but this is not a perfect solution. Similarly, if data is lost or destroyed the system will not function correctly.
