### Describe your approach

The solution must divert time invested away from the RM, without causing additional stresses to the customers in order to retain the business. For this to be successful - the approach must use the data collected about both the customers and the relationship managers to streamline the process, rather than relying on automated survey systems on the customer's end.

This narrows the possible solutions down. The system will have to be automated to manage the large quantity of both customers and staff. Therefore, the system will connect customer with RM's based on one of the following criteria:

1. Predefined attributes given to each party upon contact with the company, based on evaluation, that match the RM's skills with the customer's requirements.
2. Attributes that are self identified by the RM and customer, that establish the RM's personal understanding of their skill set, and the customer's personal requirements in a relationship manager.

Unfortunately these values are static, modifiable only through manual changes. It will therefore require a more dynamic process afterwards to ensure the relevancy of the data. This could be achieved via a dynamic system: a process that evaluates the interractions RM's have with the customers based on the outcome - did the customer buy a product? Did they send a complaint? And uses this information to create a portfolio for each RM and customer with information about positive and negative interractions. This portfolio can link RM's and customers with each other based on the previous experiences they had with similar RM's or customers.
