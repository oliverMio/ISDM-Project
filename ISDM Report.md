# ISDM Report

## Tasks

Each group will produce a business report of not more than 2000 words covering the following tasks in relation to an information systems development project:

---

1. Outline the objectives of the project and define the problem (Steps 1 & 2 of Design Thinking Methodology). (Terry)
2. Identify stakeholders. (Terry)
3. Describe your approach from a Design Thinking principles perspective.(Oliver)
4. Explain the agile methodology, namely, Scrum you have used to carry out the procedure. In your explanation, ensure that you outline activities from Scrum that you use.(William)
5. List assumptions you have made in the systems analysis.(William)
6. Document your proposed work products and models. (Aliza)
7. Discuss the competitive advantages might be gained in developing the new information system. Identify and discuss the possible adverse effects for this Business if its information system project fails (Oliver)
8. Document in GitHub all your iteration and models as you progress.

## Describe your Approach

The solution must divert time invested away from the RM, without causing additional stresses to the customers in order to retain the business. For this to be successful - the approach must use the data collected about both the customers and the relationship managers to streamline the process, rather than relying on automated survey systems on the customer's end.

This narrows the possible solutions down. The system will have to be automated to manage the large quantity of both customers and staff. Therefore, the system will connect customer with RM's based on one of the following criteria:

1. Predefined attributes given to each party upon contact with the company, based on evaluation, that match the RM's skills with the customer's requirements.
2. Attributes that are self identified by the RM and customer, that establish the RM's personal understanding of their skill set, and the customer's personal requirements in a relationship manager.

Unfortunately these values are static, modifiable only through manual changes. It will therefore require a more dynamic process afterwards to ensure the relevancy of the data. This could be achieved via a dynamic system: a process that evaluates the interactions RM's have with the customers based on the outcome - did the customer buy a product? Did they send a complaint? And uses this information to create a portfolio for each RM and customer with information about positive and negative outcomes. This portfolio can link RM's and customers with each other based on the previous experiences they had with similar RM's or customers.

## Agile Methodology

A system development project cycle can be an unpredictable and challenging process where adaptation may be required to keep up with developing requirements and technology. To allow for more flexibility, we decided to utilize the Scrum framework. Scrum is an agile project management methodology which is characterized by consistent meetings (sprints), regular feedback and collaboration between team members.

The main scrum activity employed during this project were sprints. Sprints are allotted time periods where the development team takes on more specific, focused tasks and delivers them by the end of the time frame. It is very beneficial to a team to divide up a sizable project into smaller segments with regular interaction between members. In this case, we decided that sprint lengths of 3 to 5 days were appropriate.

To prepare for a sprint, we would meet and discuss what we would like to complete for this sprint and how we plan to do so. During the sprints we would continue to communicate as much as possible to ensure we could properly respond to any changes to the sprint plan. This amount of communication allowed us to keep each other ‘in the loop’ with each other's progress whilst being able to focus on our own tasks.

## Assumptions

To understand where improvements can be made by the new proposed system, first we must understand exactly how the existing CMC works. By analysing the existing system we will know its flaws and strengths which allows us to determine what may be kept and integrated into the proposed system. In order to do so, we had to make a number of assumptions about the CMC, the RMs and Inbound & Outbound Calls. They are as follows:

CMC system

- The major travel company’s existing CMC isn’t sufficient enough to respond to the customer demand
- Inbound calls were being placed into a queue waiting to be rerouted by a receptionist to the first available RM.
- The best suited RM were not being assigned to the correct calls.
- The existing profiler tool will be sufficient enough to support the new proposed system in creating customer profiles.

RM

- RMs sales would improve if correctly assigned to customers
- All current RMs have a customized profile
- RMs are more likely to successfully sell to returning customers

Inbound Calls

- Customers kept waiting for too long will hang up
- Inbound calls that are more likely to become end-customers are not currently being prioritized by the CRC
- Customer details are being stored in the database after an inbound call
  
Outbound Calls

- Potential customer information being pulled from the database are previously inbound calls

## Advantages and Disadvantages

The automatic adjustment of customer requirements, and the lack of automated surveys ensures the customer is treated to the best service at little to no expense on their part. This provides an important connection between the company and its customers.

While the company's objective is to help customers more efficiently, this also helps the customer get what they want faster, building even stronger relationships between the two.

The reliance on the system to create matches between RMs and customers creates an unfortunate situation in which any failure in the new system could be critical for business operations. The documentation it creates however, regarding RM and customer portfolios, can allow for functional connections to be made during shutdown, but this is not a perfect solution. Similarly, if data is lost or destroyed the system will not function correctly.
