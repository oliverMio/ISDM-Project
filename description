Use case diagram
The use case diagram describes the business goal that the system is supposed to satisfy and acts as a starting point to highlight the user requirements. 
This diagram shows how the relationship manager, who is one of the actors calls the customer and makes sales by reading the script generated by the system. 
He then proceeds to finalise the sale.
In some cases, the customer might ring the call centre first at which point they will be directed to a relationship manager if they are available
The relationship manager will then use the guidelines generated to make and finalise the sale
However, during busy periods the customerâ€™s call will be directed to an interactive voice response. 
The customer will have the option of waiting for their turn to speak to the relationship manager or they can choose to hang up

Activity diagram
The activity diagram goes into more detail by illustrating all the activities taking place.
The system targets a potential customer and matches them with a suitable relationship manager.
The customer details and the script are then presented to the relationship manager who then makes the sale.
However, if the customer calls first the subsequent steps are shown in the activity diagram starting from the customer dialling the call centre to them speaking with the relationship manager or hanging up due to the wait which is where the flow is terminated.

Class diagram
The class diagram then shows the structure of the system.
The many to many relationships between the customer and relationship manaer indicates that relationship managers and customers can change for each call. 
Each relationship manager has to fill out a questionnaire. This questionnaire is also filled out by many relationship managers.
Each customer has a profile created by the profiler tool. 
And a relationship manager can sell many products and the same product can be sold by many relationship manager

Collaboration diagram
The collaboration diagram then captures the interaction that represents the flow of message. 
The customer is matched with the relationship manager after they were selected from the target list.
If it is true that the relationship manager calls the customer and then proceeds to sell the product and finalises the sale.
Otherwise, the customer calls the CMC first. 
The call is then directed and a score is calculated for the customer.
If the score is high the call is answered straight away, if not they are further directed to an integrated voice response. 
The customer is then matched with a relationship manager.
If they find a match the call is answered, if not they have to wait some more or they can choose to hang up.
